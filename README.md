# Infix Backtick: Worked Examples

[![OpenSSF Baseline](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/12577/baseline)](https://www.bestpractices.dev/projects/12577)

Real code from the ranges and senders idioms, rewritten with the infix backtick
operator, and compiled by the two prototype compilers that implement it.

`views::filter(r, pred)` is the primary overload. `views::filter(pred)` is a closure
that remembers `pred` and waits for a range, and `operator|` is what finally applies
it. Two of those three exist because C++ has no way to write the first one between
its arguments.

```c++
r | views::filter(pred) | views::transform(fn)      // today
r `views::filter` pred `views::transform` fn        // the same calls
```

The design, the plan, and both compiler prototypes live in the
[backtick](https://github.com/steve-downey/backtick) repo. This one only uses them.
`backtick-examples.org` is the reading order; `make presentation` exports it, pulling
the code straight out of the sources so nothing in the prose can drift from what
compiles.

## The examples

Every example ships twice, from two sources that differ only in how they spell their
calls: `<name>.pipe.cpp` and `<name>.backtick.cpp`. Both are built by the same
compiler at the same settings, and `<name>.equivalent` requires their output to be
identical and to match a checked-in `<name>.expected`. Two programs agreeing isn't
evidence on its own, so the golden is what pins the behaviour and the pairwise diff
is what pins the claim that only the spelling changed. The `.pipe` half is compiled
with `-fno-backtick`, so it is code proven to build with the feature off.

| | |
|---|---|
| `src/examples/ranges/triples` | Niebler's Pythagorean triples, nested |
| `src/examples/ranges/sieve` | Eratosthenes; every stage converts |
| `src/examples/ranges/calendar` | Niebler's calendar, ported to `std::ranges` and `std::chrono` |
| `src/examples/senders/chain` | `just`/`then`/`when_all`/`sync_wait` |
| `src/examples/senders/hop` | `starts_on` and `continues_on`, which the pipe could never spell |
| `src/examples/senders/scan` | P2300's async inclusive scan, and where the operator stops |
| `src/examples/donotation/carryon` | a Haskell `do` block, desugared onto beman.transpose's Monad |
| `src/examples/scorecard` | one compiled instance of each interface shape |
| `src/examples/consteval` | a pipeline evaluated entirely at compile time, sized from the command line |
| `src/examples/gating` | proof that nothing here builds without the flag |

`consteval` is the one pair that is not there to be read as an idiom. It exists to
be measured: it runs its whole pipeline in a `static_assert`, and `-DSMD_EVAL_N=400`
resizes the work so the cost of a spelling can be read as a curve rather than a
single number. The assert checks the pipeline against a hand-written loop over the
same sieve, so it holds at every size and the sweep needs no table of answers.

`src/smd/infix/pipe.hpp` is the only library code: one combinator, for the adaptors
that take nothing beyond their subject and so have no second operand to write.

## What it turned up

Writing these found two things one-line examples would not have, both recorded in
the backtick repo's deviation ledgers:

- **DEV-06 / DEV-G12.** A type name in the operator slot (design D16, carried in the
  paper's wording example as ``a `std::pair` b``) is not implemented by either
  prototype, in any spelling.
- **DEV-G11.** GCC rejects a bare slot name in a dependent context; Clang accepts it.

Repros for both are in `docs/divergences/`.

## What it costs

`make compare` measures the two spellings against each other and writes
`docs/comparison/<toolchain>.md`. It asks three questions: does the same program
come out, what did the compiler spend to produce it, and what did the constant
evaluator spend. Only the clang-23 prototype is measured so far.

Both halves of a pair are compiled from a file of the *same name* in different
directories, which is what makes the strong form of the answer available: the
objects can be compared byte for byte, because the source name in `.strtab` was
the only thing that differed. Every pair is a bit-identical object at `-O2` and
`-O3` except `calendar`, and `calendar` differs only in what two closure types
are called -- identical `.text`, no symbol a different size, and assembly that
matches once anonymous-lambda ordinals are renumbered.

At `-O0` they do differ, and the backtick side is smaller every time, by 1369
bytes of `.text` on `scan` up to 7354 on `calendar`. That is the closure objects:
the pipe spelling instantiates `_RangeAdaptor` and `_Partial` specializations for
each stage, and the infix spelling never makes them. The optimizer erases the
difference; the front end does not do the same work.

Constant evaluation is the one exact measurement, since `-fconstexpr-steps`
bisects to a count rather than a time. Over the `consteval` pair at four sizes the
infix spelling costs a flat 43 steps less -- 5757 against 5714 at n=100, 42745
against 42702 at n=800 -- with the same 52 steps per element on both sides. A
constant offset, not a slope.

Compile time is the axis this repo can say least about. The differences are near
the resolution of a busy machine, so the harness interleaves the variants and
compiles a *control* -- the pipe source a second time under another name -- to
measure what the host contributes on its own. Where a gap does clear that floor,
it has so far been the extra `#include <smd/infix/pipe.hpp>`: the backtick TUs
pay about 0.16s of front end for the header, and the spelling itself has never
cost more than the control.

The checked-in timings were taken on a workstation doing other things at the
time, and the `machine` column says so on the rows where it matters. Sources
proven to generate identical code do not time identically here, which makes the
difference environmental rather than something left to find. No claim rests on
that section: it is not gated, not kept current, and if it is ever worth pinning
down it belongs on a quiet machine in CI. The other two axes need no such
apology -- both are deterministic, and both reproduce exactly from run to run.

## Building

Nothing here builds with a stock compiler. The three toolchains that work are the
prototypes, installed by `ops/build/configure-*-backtick.sh` in the backtick repo:

| `TOOLCHAIN=` | Prefix | Compiler |
|---|---|---|
| `clang-23-backticks` (default) | `~/install/clang-23-backtick` | clang 23.1.0-rc2 |
| `clang-trunk-backticks` | `~/install/clang-trunk-backtick` | clang 24.0.0git |
| `gcc-backticks` | `~/install/gcc-trunk-backtick` | g++ 17.0.0 |

So `make` alone builds with the release/23.x clang prototype, and
`make TOOLCHAIN=gcc-backticks` builds with the GCC one. Each toolchain gets its own
`.build/build-$(TOOLCHAIN)` tree, so all three coexist. By default the build and test
is address sanitized, plus some compatible sanitizers. Alternatives are specified with
CONFIG, e.g. `make TOOLCHAIN=gcc-backticks CONFIG=RelWithDebInfo`.

An example is only done when all three agree. Where the Clang and GCC prototypes
disagree, that is a finding for `ops/gcc/DEVIATIONS.md` in the backtick repo, and the
example gets adjusted afterwards.

## Divergences from the copier template

This project is generated from [steve-downey/example](https://github.com/steve-downey/example)
and mostly follows it. `copier update` will conflict on these deliberate changes:

- `Makefile` defaults `TOOLCHAIN` to `clang-23-backticks` instead of falling back to
  `etc/toolchain.cmake` and the system compiler, and drops the `papers/wg21` targets
  (the paper this code feeds lives in the backtick repo).
- `CMakePresets.json` replaces the eight Beman CI presets with one per prototype.
- `.github/workflows/{ci_tests.yml,test_makefile.yaml,codeql.yml}` are removed: they
  compile the project in containers with stock compilers, which cannot work here.
  The pre-commit, doxygen, dependency-review, and scorecard workflows are kept.
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` runs the prototype's `clang-format`, since only that one
  has a rule for the operator, and skips `*.expected`, which is golden output compared
  byte for byte. It also skips the vendored `infra/` subtree.
- `cmake/add_paired_example.cmake`, `cmake/compare-output.cmake`,
  `cmake/compare-golden.cmake` and `cmake/require-gated.cmake` are new.


## Building presentations with Emacs and org-transclusion

This project uses [nobiot's org-transclusion](https://github.com/nobiot/org-transclusion) and org-export to produce an HTML file for use in presentations. Every example carries `// <uuid>` … `// <uuid> end` anchor pairs, and `backtick-examples.org` names them, so the prose gets the code that actually compiled and no more of it than is useful.

`make presentation` builds the project, runs the tests, and then runs the org export.

The `infra` directory is vendored in from the Beman Project via `git subtree`.

The makefile provides a variety of tools. It will install most borrowing from PyPI as long as `uv` is available. The installation is in a local `.venv` so as not to mess up the rest of your environment.

`docs` and `mrdocs` are not included in the example at the moment.

`lint` uses pre-commit to drive the various lint tools.

Use this project as you see fit.

The code in infra is Apache 2.0 licensed, see https://github.com/bemanproject/infra for more details. The CMakeLists.txt is derived from https://github.com/bemanproject/exemplar the purpose of which is to be a concrete but boring example of a well behaved CMake C++ project using the current tools and practices.

The css in `etc/`  is exported from emacs based on the modus tinted themes via `org-html-htmlize-generate-css` .

The Makefile that drives the workflow is mine, is Apache 2.0 licensed, and take what you need from it. No part of it is interesting enough to be protected.
